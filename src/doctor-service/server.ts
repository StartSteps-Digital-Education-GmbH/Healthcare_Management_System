// Step 1: Import the Express framework to build a web server

// Step 2: Import the routes for managing doctor-related operations

// Step 3: Create an instance of the Express application to handle requests and responses

// Step 4: Define the port on which the doctor service will run, defaulting to 3002 if not specified

// Step 5: Use middleware to automatically parse incoming JSON requests, making it easier to work with request data

// Step 6: Set up the application to use the doctor routes for handling requests directed to the '/doctors' endpoint

// Step 7: Start the server and listen for incoming requests on the specified port

// Step 8: Log a message to the console indicating that the Doctor Service is running and on which port
